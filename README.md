#   Human Activity Recognition 
\* *This repository was coded by myself and [ateexD](https://github.com/ateexD)* \*
* This repository contains code to our research work/publication, ***Design Optimization Of Activity Recognition System on an Embedded Platform*** which primarily aims to design an Activity Recognition Engine that is optimized over computational complexity, power consumed and cost without compromising on the efficiency.

* Optimization of computational complexity was carried out by reducing the number of features to be extracted. A set of seven simple time domain features were extracted to classify an activity. 

* The power consumption of the overall system was brought down by reducing the number of sensors used. The system was built with a single accelerometer in use which is used to get the data to compute and classify an activity. Thus bringing down the number of sensors to 1 also brings down the points of failure in the system.

* The system was deployed on Raspberry Pi Zero ($5) which reduced the cost of the system. The selection of minimal number of sensors to contributes to this.
